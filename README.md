# RPE1_pip_fucci_wt
This notebook contains results from an experiment where RPE-1 PIP-FUCCI cells (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342071/) were FACS sorted from a 50% confluent T75 treated tissue culture flask (F12 DMEM media, 10% FBS).  

96 cells were sorted according to expression of the cell cycle tracking markers from this line generating 4 different groups: (1) mVENUShigh (G1-Big cells), mVENUSlow (G1-small cells), mCHERRYhigh (S-phase cells), and mVENUS+mCHERRY+ (G2-M phase cells).  


The notebook contains information on pre-processing (including filtering low quality cells and low expressed genes).  Transcriptional assessment of cell cycle state is shown next to PIP-FUCCI marker determination of cell cycle state from index-sorted FACS isolation.
